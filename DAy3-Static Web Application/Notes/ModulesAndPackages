Custom modules/packages: 
              These modules/packages are created and defined by the user.
You need not install a custom module. Example: main.js, calculator.js

Third-party modules/packages:
              These modules/packages are provided by Node Package
Manager. They have already been created by someone else for you. You need to install a
third-party module via NPM and import the module using the require function while providing
the name of the module as the ID to start using it. eg: npm-install-status-codes

Core modules:
             Provided by the language(our case Node.js).
             These modules are provided by Node by default; you need not define them.
Also, these are not required to be installed prior to their usage. You can simply use the require
function to import a core module to start using it. Eg: console.log, http(not done any installation),
react hooks.
