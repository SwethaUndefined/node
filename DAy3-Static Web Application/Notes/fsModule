The most common fs module APIs can perform the following operations:
○ Read files
■ fs.readFile()
○ Create files
■ fs.appendFile()
■ fs.open()
■ fs.writeFile()
○ Update files
■ fs.appendFile()
■ fs.writeFile()
○ Delete files
■ fs.unlink()
○ Rename files
■ fs.rename()


In the example index.js, fs.readFile().  Inside parantheses, the first argument is path that needs to read
the second parameter is callback fn.... Then the callback fn takes two argument, one is error, the next is
data that is received. then handle the error.

fs.appendFile() == used to add the extra content
fs.writeFile()=== Delete the previous content and add the new content.
fs.rename()==used to rename the file, (first argument is the file name, second as new file name which has
to be change, third is callback fn)
fs.unlink()== delete the file.
fs.open()==check whether the file is open or not.
