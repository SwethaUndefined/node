organized collection of data, so that it can be easily accessed and managed.
Query to work with DB:
1.Create 2.Read 3.Update 4.Delete.

Difference b/w sequential and non sequential:
Sequential is succeeding or following in order while nonsequential 
is not sequential; not in any regular sequence

In DB we can store the data and manipulate using queries like Create, Read, Delete and Update.

Schema , means structure of data.

1.Fixed schema                                     1.Dynamic schema   
2.Scaled                                           2.NoSQL databases are more suitable for horizontal 
more servers to improve performance                 scaling, where you keep adding more servers to 
vertically by increasing the CPU and RAM            improve performance
to increase the power of the existing
database

MongoDB documents are similar to JSON objects

{
